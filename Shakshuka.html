      Ingredients 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 large onion, chopped 3 garlic
      cloves, minced 1 large red bell pepper, chopped 1 teaspoon ground cumin 1
      teaspoon smoked paprika 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper 1 can (28 ounces)
      whole peeled tomatoes 4-6 eggs Salt and black pepper to taste Crumbled
      feta cheese and chopped fresh parsley for garnish Pita bread, for serving
      Preparation Time 30 minutes Instructions Heat the olive oil in a large
      skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and cook until softened, about 5
      minutes. Add the garlic and cook for an additional minute. Add the bell
      pepper, cumin, paprika, and cayenne pepper and cook for another 5-7
      minutes, stirring occasionally, until the pepper has softened. Pour in the
      can of tomatoes and their juices, breaking them up with a spoon or spatula
      as you go. Simmer for 10-15 minutes, until the sauce has thickened
      slightly. Crack the eggs into the skillet, making little wells in the
      sauce with a spoon or spatula. Cover the skillet and cook for 5-10
      minutes, or until the eggs are cooked to your liking. Sprinkle crumbled
      feta cheese and chopped parsley over the top of the dish. Serve hot with
      pita bread on the side. Enjoy!
